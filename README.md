# CHIMExIllustrisTNG
Intended to store code and mock catalogs and intensity maps related to Polzin, Newburgh, and Natarajan (2022).

There are 4 (pre-beam convolution) intensity maps in the maps directory of this repository:
1. all galaxies (non-cluster galaxies and cluster galaxies)
2. non-cluster galaxies
3. mass-selected galaxy clusters
4. radius selected galaxy clusters

Additionally, there are catalogs corresponding to each of these intensity maps in the catalogs directory and code used in the creation and analysis of mock intensity maps in the analysis directory.
